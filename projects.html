          Developed a model that determines the positivity or negativity of any
          given review, whether it's about a product, a movie, or food, etc.
          This included training the model in Python using a dataset and
          incorporating various antonyms, synonyms, and punctuation marks to
          enhance its accuracy. To achieve this, Negation Handling was used to
          pay particular attention to analyzing negative reviews with positive
          phrases. To make the model more interactive, a feature was integrated
          which allows users input their own reviews and obtain an immediate
          sentiment. To acheive this, Streamlit, an open-source platform, was
          used to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to input
          reviews and interact with the responses (positive or negative).

          Specifies a protocol that enables inter-client communication in
          real-time. Messages are sent and received by a server from various
          users. These users have the ability to create, enter, and exit rooms
          as well as send private messages to other users. A message delivered
          by one user is received by all the users if they are all in the same
          room.
