            I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at PSU, and I
            couldn't be more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. My
            focus is on databases track but I am also interested in Programming
            and Software Engineering as well. I earned my Bachelor's degree in
            Information Technology which gave me a strong foundation in
            programming, data structures, and algorithms. After completing my
            degree, I worked as an analyst at Accenture and TCS from India,
            where I gained a perspective on data. These experiences helped me
            develop a keen eye for data. I strongly believe that data is the
            foundation of many businesses and am constantly fascinated by the
            way that data can be used to solve complex problems and drive
            innovation.
